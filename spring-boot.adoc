**_dependency injection_**  
to avoid tight coupling, we can decouple by using an interface.

in example:  
❌ keyboardA & keyboardB.  
✅ keyboard interface, keyboardA implements keyboard, keyboardB implements keyboard.  

**_open closed principle_**
a class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

this principle is very useful, we only need to add new class if there's a new feature without touching the exists code so we can avoid potential of bugs and errors.

**_spring ioc (inversion of control)_**
spring ioc = spring can create objects and inject them into our classes.

**_annotations_**
* component for telling spring to manage object of type order service
* service for classes that contains business logic
* repository for classes that interact with the database
* controller for classes that handling web request

we actually can use @service instead @component for service classes but its back depends on code style from team.
